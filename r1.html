         <h5> Part 1</h5>
		<p>
      <h5><b>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</b></h5>
      <br>
        -A good definition of “system” is a group of various parts working together towards a common cause. A not-as-good definition of “system” may be a group of parts that don't work together for the same cause.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q2. -- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</b></h5>
      <br>
        -<b>Modularity</b> is a system where parts are interchangeable with order or function. For example, a car typically has 4 wheels which all have the function of moving the car. Even if the driver side wheel switched places with the passenger side wheel, the car can still move from one place to another.
      <br>
        -<b>Decomposability</b> is the ultimate limit of how far something can be simplified. For example, a piece of aluminum foil is made up of many aluminum atoms. As one keeps tearing the foil, theoretically, the foil will eventually become one aluminum atom. And if that atom was to be split up into protons, electrons, and neutrons, it will no longer be aluminum.
      <br>
        -<b>Emergence</b> is the complex product of many simpler parts working together as a result of demand. For example, public bus routes are simple routes but get more complex as more bus routes are added to meet the demand of transit in different areas.
      <br>
        -<b>Chaos Theory</b> is in everchanging environments, when initial little actions exponentially grow into bigger actions, they result in major and unpredictable outcomes. For example, if someone posts a video on youtube, tiktok, Instagram, etc, (highly variable platforms with their ever changing algorithms), if the algorithm favors the video, the video can become viral, making the user famous.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q3. -- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</b></h5>
      <br>
        -Modularity focuses on using interchangeable parts that would not effect the outcome regardless of change with order or role. While tessellations can be done with only one tile type (monohedral) so all the pieces would be interchangeable, tessellations also include other ways of tiling involving two tiles (dihedral); more and different types of symmetry (periodic) or no symmetry at all (aperiodic).
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q4. -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</b></h5>
      <br>
        -Aperiodic tends to have an irregular/unpredictable pattern while periodic tends to have a uniform/predictable pattern. Aperiodic design would be good for luck-based games where randomness is vital. Periodic design is good for systems needing predictability such as story-based/skill-based games.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q5. -- What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentances.</b></h5>
      <br>
        -A System Diagram is a mind map of how all the parts of system connect to one another while an exploded view drawing/ladybug diagram shows all the parts zoomed within a system. While both diagrams showcase the components of a system, a system diagram focuses more on the links between the components while an exploded view drawing focuses more visually on the individual parts of the systems.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q6 Group Activity.
        As a group, work togather to find 8 system diagrams describing systems from all kind of different fields or domains. First, these system diagrams should be good examples that show traits of either:
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Modularity</li>
        <li>Decomposibility</li>
        <li>Emergence</li>
        <li>Chaos Theory</li></b></h5>

      <p><b>Modularity:</b> Different devices can be plugged into the computer as inputs or outputs. Inside the CPU, the hard drive can be replaced with many different storage sizes (500gb, 1tb, etc) and types (ssd/hard drive).</p>

By following the family tree down, we can see what tardigrades can be simplified and related to (mostly worms). </p>

      <p><b>Emergence:</b> The demand of internet depends on the technological development of an area as well as its population. Places that are more developed and have more people living there will have higher internet traffic, resulting in bigger circles around those areas and a more complex web of connections. </p>
