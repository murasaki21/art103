          <b>Artist Statement</b>
          <br>
          Similar to the paper tesslations, we all started with equilateral triangles. Anshu made our common edge: two stars with one in and one out. Sharing that common edge, everyone created their own unique triangle. While Anshu and I stuck with
          using shapes to "cut out" and customize our traingles, Chienyu and Richard used the pen tool to create curves and other unique edges. My edge was created by merging a star in between two circles. Initially using the pathfinder tool was
          slightly difficult since I was still learning what each one of the tools did such as divide, unite, subtract, etc.

              <br>
              For the handcut fastners, we decided two people for paper (Anshu and me) fastners and two people for foam fastners (Chienyu and Richard). My fastner was starlike and used diagonal knotches at the points to connect to the other fastners.
              When all the fastners are connected, it forms a ball similar to a ball lamp. The shape is quite sturdy as well. While the pieces are modular and interchangeable with one another, they are limited to making a spherical sculpture.
              Although both Anshu and I used paper knotches, her sculpture came out looking very different from mines since she used paper strips.

                    <br>
                    In order to get a broad range of materials and cuts to test out, we assigned two people to do wood fastners and two people for paper/plike. Anshu used wood slots and Richard used wood dovetail slots. While Chienyu used paper
                    knotches, I used paper slots. While the key for the pinapple would be bent and stand up, the key for the bird stayed flat. When cutting out the slots with the laser, I overestimated the thickness of plike and ended up using the
                    thinnest slots for the key to fit snugly. While plike fastners are thinner, more flexible, and faster to cut, with this slot fastner, making them stand and become more complex 3D sculptures would be difficult and very unstable.
                    While we didn't end up using any of our fastners for our final deliverable, we realized using wood would allow us to create bigger and more stable structures compared to plike.

                   After we settled on making a fashion-focused set of pieces, we talked about possible materials and fastners. While we all unamiously agreed on using wood and doing a 3D design, we talked about several types of connectors including knotches, keys, and pegs. After sketching out our choices and doing a laser cut test for the pegs, we decided to use peg fastners for our mannequins and clothing pieces. For the stage, initially it was only going to be one mannequin on a stagelike box (as seen in the concept drawing). However, after talking with Steve, he brought up using interlocking stages, leading to Richard designing a stage made of four triangles that can interlock with one another and within the triangles, there is a circle of pegs so users can position the mannequin in a variety of angles.

                  <br>
                   With the theme of fashion and being in charge of pants, I wanted to design a variety of bottomwear. While some of the bottoms were more casual everyday wear such as the burgandy skirt and the white shorts, I also wanted to design more unique pieces such as bright orange flared pants, semi-baggy pants with straps everywhere, and black underwear. And since Halloween is coming up soon, I also designed ninja pants. The long pink skirt was supposed to be a pink poodle skirt as a nod to 50s fashion and as a costume piece, but I didn't have enough time to paint a poodle, so it ended up being a plain pink skirt. However, since it's plain, it's easier to pair up with other outfits and since the items aren't specifically tied to a certain era. Since none of us coordinated together to create specific outfits when designing pieces for our respective catagories (Me: bottomwear, Anshu: tops and wings, Richard: accessories and jackets, Chienyu: headwear and footwear), this created more possibilities and spontaneity when putting together outfits for the photoshoot. While we did not coordinate specific outfits, themes that we talked about when designing the pieces included: casualwear, avante-garde, cosplay,  and costumes.

                   After we all desgined our respective pieces, it was time to create a test cut with a mannequin and a set of clothing items (see right image in Mock Up Prints) on Thursday October 13th. Originally, I wanted to also print out a stage platform, but due to time constraints, I was only able to print out the mannequin and a set of clothing items. Some of the pieces weren't completely cut out from the wood, but a little bit of pushing with a pen led them to slip out relatively easily. With the pegs cut out from the mannequin, I glued them to the clothing items to see if they slipped out of the pegs. While some of the pegs held on to the mannequin perfectly such as the pants and wings, some of them pegs were slightly looser. However, it was easily fixed with layering paint and mod podge on the pegs.

                   After a successful cut on Thursday, Chienyu and I went to the classroom on the next day around 1:15pm to get the rest of the pieces cut out. This was arguably the most stressful day other than the day before the presentation. To give some context, before coming in to do the cut, I just finished a full body workout and didn't eat much before and after working out. I expected the laser cutting and peg gluing to take at most three hours, but it took much longer than that due to many unforseen circumstances. To start off, I formatted the pieces to fit about 1 and half pieces of wood. However, someone accidently used one of our pieces of wood, leading to me spending the next hour reformatting the PDFs to fit the wood we had left. After reformatting the pieces, we got to using the laser cutter. Although I was aware that the laser wasn't cutting the best yesterday, I didn't expect it to get worse this day. Because the wood didn't cut all the way (even with the correct RGB and material settings) for about 80% of the pieces, Chienyu and I ended up spending about 4-5 hours using a utility knife to cut out the pieces and sand away the splinters. Since some of the pieces were pretty small and really stuck to the wood, several pieces ended up breaking and needing to be reprinted. We ended up staying in the classroom until 7pm. We were hungry and tired, but at least it was done.

                   During the weekend, I painted all of the pieces that we cut out successfully. This was when I learned spending a couple extra dollars on paint and paintbrushes would really make the process faster. Since the paints I used were on the thinner side, any light colored paint such as white or pastel would take about 5 layers of paint to be fully covered. And with the small little paint brushes that would slowly fall apart while I washed them, painting anything with light colors (especially the stage pieces) was a tedious task. Due to this along with other homework assignments, I ended up staying up till 3am painting on both Saturday and Sunday.

                   When Monday came along, after my first class ended at 11:45, I went to the classroom to pick up the wood to get the pieces that broked reprinted. Since there was another group in there already printing, I waited about 2 hours before I was able to use it. However, during this time, I was able to paint the remaining pieces that I didn't get to during the weekend. After getting the pieces recut, I was able to borrow some mod podge from a friend to help seal some of the pieces cut out as well as give some shine to them. During this time, Anshu worked on taking photos and designing the final schema. During class, we realized there were some pieces we forgot to print (mostly for the stage), so we created another PDF with those pieces. We also worked together to seal more pieces.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   On the next day, Anshu and I came to the laser room at 3pm to get our remaining pieces cut out. Chienyu had class during this time so she couldn't come. After waiting for a group to finish with printing, I reformatted the pieces to take up as little space as possible, and started the final cut. This time, the pieces came out of the wood like butter, saving us time with hand cutting and sanding. We both worked together to paint and seal the remaining pieces so they can be used for the video when Richard came. Since Richard had to pick up someone, he came to the laser room later than us. When he arrived, we all put together some outfits, took photos and videos of the outfits, and set up the stage and lights (thanks Anshu for letting us use your lights) for the video. While Richard was mainly in charge for the video, I helped with filming some of my own shots and suggesting how the stage can be set up with two levels. After 3 1/2 hours, we finished recutting, painting, sealing, documenting (knolling and examples).

                   Reflecting on the project, the fashion concept and peg fastners worked out well overall. While there were pieces that were looser than others, most of them stayed on pretty well. With paint, if possible, spend a little bit extra on better paint and paint brushes to save time. While it did get the desired effect, it would be much easier and faster to just spend a little more on better supplies at the start. While there were several issues out of our control, it did lead to our group having to compromise and adapt to these changes. While we can't truly predict fashion trends, maybe wings and katanas will become a thing one day.
