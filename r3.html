        <h5> Reading Questions</h5>
        <p>
        <h5><b>Q1. -- From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this effect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.</b>
        </h5>
        <br>
        -Until the late 1960s, since we only have the bones of dinosaurs, we did not have much context of what dinosaurs would look like. Basing it off current large animals such as elephants and hippos which are large and slow, since dinosaurs’
        bones are large, people thought for a while that dinosaurs were bulky and slow. For example, according to Dr. Robert Bakker, Brontosaurus and Diplodocus were portrayed as “giant, gray vacuum cleaners with very very short legs” with sluggish
        movement or sitting in a swamp.
        <br>
        <br>
        With the advent of Paleontology and Archeology, the concept of slow and lethargic dinosaurs was turned upside down. Paleontologist Jon Ostrom discovered a new raptor species called Deinonychus. From the skeleton’s anatomy, Ostrom determined
        that the species fast and agile despite its large size. The discovery changed how dinosaurs were portrayed and during the 70s, dinosaur illustrations used Ostrom’s and Bakker’s theories and drew dinosaurs as vibrant and intelligent creatures.
        Hence, the 70s were nicknamed as the Dinosaur Renaissance.

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5><b>Q2. -- The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based
            disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques that reminds you of this method or process. Please elaborate with your examples both written as well as images and links.</b></h5>
        <br>
        -<b>Criminology and Forensics</b>
        <br>
        Criminology uses any available evidence to figure out who did the crime and how they did it. While it’s possible to recreate some crime scenes, criminologists may need to speculate certain parts of how a crime was done or who did it,
        especially with cold cases. Similar to how Conway taking liberty in illustrating how dinosaurs may have looked. For example, forensic sketch artists are in charge of illustrating a suspect’s face based only on verbal details.

        -<b>Set Designers</b>
        <br>
        When creating historical or fantastical scenery, set designers are tasked to create a place based on verbal descriptions, historical references such as artworks and letters, or even past films/stage shows. For example, in "The Little Mermaid
        Live!" show, an interactive underwater set design was created involving physical props such as rocks along with led lights and projection mapping simulating the underwater currents.

        <h5><b>Q3. -- First, summerize in your own words the defination of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second and fourth article. Then, given the examples in the second article as well as the other examples provided of possible future
            products, how can 'Material Speculation' also be used to create speculative objects that refer to the past? What might be an example of a fictional object form the past, that creates the same dynamic of speculation.</b></h5>
        <br>
        -Material speculation is creation of a future of an alternative universe based on objects or concepts in grasp. An example of material speculation is the obscura 1C camera. Unlike most cameras, the photos taken with this camera cannot be
        processed nor viewed unless the camera itself is destroyed. Without the ability to immediatly view photos taken, it changes people's attitudes with taking photos such as how often would someone take photos or how long is someone willing to
        wait until breaking the camera.
        <br>
        -Material speculation can create speculative objects referring to the past by through materials, culture, folklore, etc. For example, several ancient landmarks that are now destroyed/ altered can be viewed digitally through 3D recreations
        such as the Roman Colosseum.
        <br>
        -A fictional object from the past creating speculation can be the dropbear. The dropbear is a tall tale often told by Australians towards tourists of a carnivorous koala that would drop from trees and attack people.

        <h5> In Class Group Activity</h5>
        <b>Part 1: In a World</b>
        <h5><b>Each person in the group is to create Three suppositons or hypothesis. Using the words "In a world..." or simply "If...." fill in the blank.
            This can be refering to any time period (past, present or future). However each student should create a 'In a world' using:
            <br>
            <br>
            --For 1. a culture
            <br>
            --For 2. a lifeform
            <br>
            --For 3. a technology
            <br>
            <br>
            Keep them to yourself at first then share them with everyone in the group.
            <br>

            As each suppositons is shared, then let the rest in the group consider what an outcomes might be. Everyone in the group is to participate in making a speculative statement that would be a response to the supposition. The response might be
            a predictive statement or something that finishs the idea started by the supposition. It can be strange, silly, dark, etc. Nothing is too wierd. As you go, write down the suppositions and responses in your shared documeent.
            <br>
            <br>
            You should do each suppostion kind ( culture, lifeform, technology) where each student can make a supposition as well as the group responses. Also the person making a suppostion shold make a response as well.
            So for 3 peeps, there should be at least ( 3 x3 ) 9 suppositions and 27 responses total.</b></h5>

            Speculatate and brainstorm a brief description what kind of objects/artifacts that could be considered being 'byproducts' or 'artifacts' of the worlds you speculate on.
            Then Describe the following:
            1. What is the artifact look like? Breifly Describe it.
            2. How that artifact from this idea be some kind of reflection of the idea or evidence of it?
