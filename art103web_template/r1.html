         <h5> Part 1</h5>
		<p>
      <h5><b>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</b></h5>
      <br>
        -A good definition of “system” is a group of various parts working together towards a common cause. A not-as-good definition of “system” may be a group of parts that all function the same for the same cause (too much conformity).
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q2. -- For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</b></h5>
      <br>
        -<b>Modularity</b> is a system where parts are interchangeable with order or function. For example, a car typically has 4 wheels which all have the function of moving the car. Even if the driver side wheel switched places with the passenger side wheel, the car can still move from one place to another.
      <br>
        -<b>Decomposability</b> is the ultimate limit of how far something can be simplified. For example, a piece of aluminum foil is made up of many aluminum atoms. As one keeps tearing the foil, theoretically, the foil will eventually become one aluminum atom. And if that atom was to be split up into protons, electrons, and neutrons, it will no longer be aluminum.
      <br>
        -<b>Emergence</b> is the product of many simpler parts working together. For example, many songs contain several layers of sounds/beats/lyrics. If the layers were to be separated, the sounds are relatively simple. But when they are all together, they form a cohesive song.
      <br>
        -<b>Chaos Theory</b> is in everchaning environments, when initial little actions exponentially grow into bigger actions, they result in major and unpredictable outcomes. For example, if someone posts a video on youtube, tiktok, Instagram, etc, (highly variable platforms with their ever changing algorithms), if the algorithm favors the video, the video can become viral, making the user famous.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q3. -- What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</b></h5>
      <br>
        -Modularity focuses on using interchangeable parts that would not effect the outcome regardless of change with order or role. While tessellations can be done with only one tile type (monohedral) so all the pieces would be interchangeable, tessellations also include other ways of tiling involving two tiles (dihedral); more and different types of symmetry (periodic) or no symmetry at all (aperiodic).
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q4. -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</b></h5>
      <br>
        -Aperiodic tends to have an irregular/unpredictable pattern while periodic tends to have a uniform/predictable pattern. Aperiodic design would be good for luck-based games where randomness is vital. Periodic design is good for systems needing predictability such as story-based/skill-based games.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h5><b>Q5. -- What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug. Please explain in complete sentances.</b></h5>
      <br>
        -A System Diagram is a mind map of how all the parts of system connect to one another while an exploded view drawing/ladybug diagram shows all the parts zoomed within a system. While both diagrams showcase the components of a system, a system diagram focuses more on the links between the components while an exploded view drawing focuses more visually on the individual parts of the systems.
