          <br>
          Grand Century Mall is a Vietnamese mall opened in 2000 in San Jose's Little Saigon as a hub for Vietnamese Americans to hangout and shop. Although it is not as busy as it once was due to Vietnamtown opening next door and the pandemic, the
          mall is still an iconic part of Little Saigon. The mall is also a memorable place since my parents would often bring me there and to the surrounding area when I was young.

          <br>
          Lee's Sandwiches is a banh mi (Vietnamese Sandwich) shop that also sells drinks and other Vietnamese snacks. Lee's founder Chieu Le came from Vietnam to San Jose in 1980 and from buying food from catering trucks, he saw potential with the
          business. So in 1981, Le bought his first truck and started catering food around downtown San Jose. Two years after its creation, Le's parents served banh mi San Jose locals which proved to be a huge success and later became the company's
          trademark product. From the success of catering, the Le family opened the first brick and mortar store in Downtown San Jose (this location) and named it Lee's Sandwiches. For me personally, I would often come here during my lunch breaks in
          my first year. Although I don't visit here as often anymore, they still serve amazing Vietnamese food and I found it interesting that it all started here in downtown.

          <b>3. New Tung Kee Noodle House</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          New Tung Kee Noodle House is a noodle shop serving Chinese-styled noodles and rice cake dishes. The original TK noodles opened in 1983 by Tan Lu on William Street with the goal of serving delicious and affordable Chinese-styled noodles.
          Despite its unassuming appearance, it was a huge success to the point that some of Lu's family members and former business partners copied Lu's business formula from the the menu and interior design. To differentiate themselves from the
          original, they named themselves New Tung Kee Noodles and based their first location on Santa Clara Street. Rather than sue the copy, both restaurants decided to work on non-speaking terms and grow on their own terms. While some people claim
          that the original or the new one tastes better than the other, I don't really taste the difference. Regarding my personal experience with this location, whenever my family comes visit me in Downtown San Jose, they would often choose this
          location for lunch.

          <b>Artist Statement</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          New Tung Kee Noodles and TK Noodles are resturants with very similar names, interior design, menu, vibes, and logos. To the point most people would mistaken them as the same company. Despite their similarities and the potential for the original TK Noodles to sue New Tung Kee, they decided not to sue and allow both companies to grow and develop on their own accord. The two companies existing simutaneously in harmony inspired me to use the Yin Yang Symbol for both my stamp and sign.
          <br>
          <br>
          Starting with the stamp, I was trying to figure out how to convey that New Tung Kee and TK Noodles are very similar yet different. While a mirror or a coin could convey this message, it was hard to figure out how it could be translated through an ink print. Then I shifted my focus from copying/reflection towards living harmoniously which led to using the Yin Yang Symbol. On a side note, the restaurants sell Chinese-styled noodles and dishes so it was also fitting to use the Chinese symbol of harmony to convey my message. In terms of difficulties, the only major one is creating enough negative space for the bit to cut in between while retaining enough information. I had to simplify both logos quite a bit for the bit to cut between the circle and the logo which took around 9 iterations. One mistake I made when creating the stamp was not creating a deep enough cut. While it was fine for the inking process, I didn't extrude properly in Fusion, leading to a shallower cut. In terms of sucesses, by making most of my stamp elements round, I didn't need to deal with the router bit not getting into sharp corners.
          <br>
          <br>
          With the sign, I took my original design for my stamp which included the more intricate logos in the circles and exported it into Fusion. I started with a rectangle sketch, then used the circle tool to cut the rectanble, extruded the circle slightly, imported the sign SVG, extruded the SVG, then applied high glossy paint textures to the sign. Compared to the stamp, creating the sign was pretty straightfoward since I already had the base for the sign done. Compositing the sign into photoshop was pretty simple once I got the sign rendered in the right angle (took 3 tries, but it's faster than trying to create negative space for the CNC cut).
